/* TODO:
- Iterate over local extensions, and create sub projects
- parse extensionInfo.xml and add the dependencies to the sub project (evaluate if we can add them globally)
-- we could even use the extensioninfo to determine all kind of extensions needed (but, we might have issues with differentiaten between, 3rdParty and commerce)
- Still a two step start, extract, and add deps, see if missing extraction could be a problem
